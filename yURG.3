.SH SUMMARY
yURG is a set of shared c functions to provide standard, flexible, reliable, 
and detailed traceability in programs.  its purpose is to take a complex
and foundational capabilty, make it more useful, and allow it to be tested,
maintained, and documented in one place.

.SH URGENT DEFINITION
urgents are command line arguments to influence program logging, tracing, and
debugging and which run parallel to normal ones.  normal command line
arguments change the programs functioning.  urgents change what is written
about the programs execution.

.SH FORMAT
urgents are formatting consistently in order for them to stand out on the
command line.  urgents will always be prefixed with one or more "at" signs.

.B short form.  
the short form of an urgent is two characters long.  the first character is an
"at" sign (@).  the second character is a single unique lower case letter.
only the universal urgents, used in all programs, have short forms.
   @a       turns on debugging for command line arguments
   @u       turns on debugging for user interactions
   @g       turns on debugging for graphics and drawing

.B long form.  
the long form of an urgent is five or more characters long.  it starts with
two "at" signs (@@).  these two are followed by three or more lower case
letters indicating a unique urgent.
all urgents have long forms.
   @@args   turns on debugging for command line arguments
   @@user   turns on debugging for user interactions
   @@graf   turns on debugging for graphics and drawing

.B extra output form.  
both short and long form urgents MAY have an option of a second, more verbose
level of output in order to better adjust debugging volume.  if this option
is available, the urgent is simply requested with upper case letters.
   @A       turns on debugging for command line arguments
   @U       turns on debugging for user interactions
   @G       turns on debugging for graphics and drawing
   @@ARGS   turns on debugging for command line arguments
   @@USER   turns on debugging for user interactions
   @@GRAF   turns on debugging for graphics and drawing
